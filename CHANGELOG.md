# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 3.4.0 - 2023-12-19
### Features
* Added a new configuration parameter to [`KameleoonConfiguration`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/mobile-sdks/android-sdk/#initialize-the-kameleoon-client) and the [configuration](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/mobile-sdks/android-sdk/#configure-additional-properties) file:
    - `defaultTimeout` in `KameleoonConfiguration` and `default_timeout_millisecond` in the configuration file: designates the predefined timeout for network requests. The default timeout value is 10000 milliseconds.

## 3.3.0 - 2023-10-19
### Features
* Added [`getVisitorWarehouseAudience`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/android-sdk.html#getvisitorwarehouseaudience) method to retrieve all data associated with a visitor's warehouse audiences and adds it to the visitor.

## 3.2.1 - 2023-08-29
### Features
* Changed the `KameleoonClientConfig` parameters `clientId` and `clientSecret` and the external configuration file parameters, `client_id` and `client_secret` from required to optional. This means you can now successfully initialize a configuration without providing credentials. Previously, you would receive a `CredentialsNotFound` exception.

## 3.2.0 - 2023-08-21
### Features
* Added [`getRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/android-sdk.html#getRemoteVisitorData) method to synchronize visitor data across devices by fetching remote data for a visitor (and optionally, add the fetched data to the visitor.)
### Bug Fixes
* Stability and performance improvements.

## 3.1.3 - 2023-07-11
* Added new conditions for targeting:
    - Visitor Code
    - SDK Language
    - [Device](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/mobile-sdks/go-sdk/#device)
    - [Conversion](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/mobile-sdks/go-sdk/#trackconversion)

## 3.1.2 - 2023-07-04
* Improved the handling of internet connection loss for the [Real-Time Streaming Architecture](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/technical-considerations/#streaming): We have resolved a critical issue related to the [Real-Time Streaming Architecture](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/technical-considerations/#streaming). Previously, when the userâ€™s device lost internet connection, the SDK was unable to receive configuration data until the next application launch. With this update, the SDK can now successfully retrieve the required configuration data once the connection is restored without restarting the application.\
\
The user must grant your application the `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission for the SDK to determine when the network becomes accessible again. If the permission is not granted, the SDK uses [Polling Mode](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/technical-considerations/#polling) instead.


## 3.1.1 - 2023-06-27
* The minimum supported Android version for the SDK has been designated as API level 14. This implies that the SDK is compatible with devices running Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and above. By setting the minimum supported version to API level 14, the SDK ensures compatibility with a wide range of Android devices, allowing developers to target a significant portion of the Android user base.
